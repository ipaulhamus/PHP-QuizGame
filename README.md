# PHP-QuizGame

- *What is it?* This project is a simple Nintendo trivia quiz game created in PHP. The application includes 5 questions, with the last being a multiple choice question that makes use of a group of radio buttons for answer selection. The remaining questions are short answers and take text input from the user.

Once the user completes the quiz and submits the form, they receive a score that is checked by a predefined set of strings that are the correct answers. This score is calculated by the program and displayed with both the number of correct answers (Ex: 2/5) and their percentage (Ex: "40%"). The application also utilizes the Bootstrap library for page styling.
